# heartML
HeartML is a Django website that assists in diagnosing heart disease in its early stages. The website takes in user-inputted health data and uses a large dataset of patient data to predict whether the user is at risk for heart disease; based on the user data, the website provides custom suggestions to help reduce risk.
